    "\n",
    "## Game Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- The board consists of a 6x6 grid with alternating dark and light squares.\n",
    "- Each player starts with 12 pieces placed on their respective sides of the board.\n",
    "- The pieces are initially arranged in two rows, with each row containing 6 pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Piece Movement\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each player can only move their own pieces.\n",
    "- Pieces can move diagonally or straight forward one square at a time.\n",
    "- Pieces cannot move backward or sideways.\n",
    "- Pieces can capture their opponent's pieces by moving diagonally forward and landing on a square occupied by an opponent's piece.\n",
    "- Captured pieces are removed from the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game End\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a player successfully moves one of their pieces to the opposite end of the board, they win the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Players can only capture the opponent's piece if its in their diagonal forward squares and they cannot have two or more pieces of their color in the same square.\n",
    "- Players take turns moving their pieces.\n",
    "- Players must make a move on their turn, and they cannot skip their turn.\n",
    "- If a player has multiple legal moves, they can choose which piece to move."
